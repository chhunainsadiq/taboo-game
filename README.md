Here create React app is being for the boilerplate setup. 

## Folder Structure:
For folder structure it used or follows the best paractices 
mentioned here 
https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1


## Main Used Libraries:
- redux-toolkit: state management
- styled-component: for styling components
- react-select - for dropdowns
- jest, React-testing-library: unit testing


We could ahve achieve functionality for this task with React 
local state or using with useReducer but for scalability purposes 
we are using redux as state managment solution. 

## Responsiveness
Its mostly responsive but some minor tweeks may  required. 
Here to complete the task functionality I am following the
basic layout , UI and UX can be improved as per the design requirements.

## TypeSafety
Here its using Proptypes for type safety but in case required we can easily integrate Typescript to avoid run time errors.

## Testing 
Only one Taboo component UI tests have
been added. Other UI testing and redux store testing 
can be done and respective.

## ESling 
Esling config file should be added with some agreed set of rules to follow best coding paractices.
Comments can be added more.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
